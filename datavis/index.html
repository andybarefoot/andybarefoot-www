							<p><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" class="ext" target="met">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> recently published the details of 446,029 objects fromn their collection under their <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/digital-underground/2017/open-access-at-the-met"  class="ext" target="metOA">Open Access policy</a>. The data can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess" class="ext" target="github">GitHub</a>.</p>
							<p>This data visualisation attemts to show the distribution of the entire collection by date and to show the difference in age depending on the type of artifact. For example, the majority of vases in the collection are from around the year 300 A.D or before. </p>
							<p>The original data used over 1000 distinct classifications which I grouped into 36 wider classifications as best as my understanding of the classification names allowed.</p>
							<p>The data provides a text description of each object's date as well as "start" and "end" dates which bookend the possible timeframe taking into account any inaccuracy of the date. So for an object described "early 7th-mid 7th century BC" the start and end dates are -675 and -650.</p>
							<p>For an object with a range of possible creation dates this visualisation distributes the object across the full range. So an article made between 1840 and 1850 is distributed as 1/11 of an object for each year in the range 1840-1850 inclusive. This is why some years are shown as having only fractions of an item.</p>
							<p>The visualisation was made using D3.js after the raw data had been consolidated into JSON using PHP.</p>

					<p>The Unofficial Football World Championships imagines what would happen if the Football World Champions were not decided once every four years at a tournament but instead followed the boxing model.</p>
					<p>Starting from the very first international game between Scotland and England the reigning World Champions retain their crown only until the next match they lose, at which point the title transfers to their victorious opponents.</p>
					<p>This magnificent folly is documented at the <a class="ext" href="http://www.ufwc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Unofficial Football World Championships</a> and all the data used in this visualisation was sourced from the <a class="ext" href="http://www.ufwc.co.uk/results/" target="ufwc">UFWC website</a>.</p>
					<p>I wanted to build a data visualisation that showed how football has spread across the world from the first international matches between the teams of the British Isles until every continent and virtually every country had taken part. The Championship Game so far has involved teams as unlikely as Netherland Antilles, Libya, North Korea and Guam.</p>
					<p>The underlying map is built using the D3.js library with standard map functionality:<br/>
						- Zoom (limited so map cannot be smaller than display)<br/>
						- Pan (also limited to edges of display)<br/>
						- Rollover to display country name</p>
					<p>The animation loops through all 926 matches played so far displaying the details of the current match in the navigation bar. At the same time the map zooms to display an area defined by the bounding boxes of the two countries competing the match. The country of the winning team (defending champion in the case of a draw) is displayed in gold and the losers in silver.</p>
					<p>The total number of successful challenges or defences of the title is maintained throughout the animation and displayed on each country. Similarly countries that have previously held the title are displayed in a muted gold and countries that have previously challenged for the title but not yet been successful are displayed in a muted silver.</p>
					<p>On top of the map a box is displayed with the details of the current match which is dynamically positioned to overlap as little of the two featured countries as possible.</p>

					<p>The <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/" class="ext" target="_blank">Premier League</a> is England's highest professional football league. The 20 clubs in the league pay large salaries to get the best players from all over the world. This data visualisation looks just how far the players have travelled to play in the Premier League.</p>
					<p>I scraped all the data from Wikipedia at the beginning of the 2016/2017 season using the pages for each club to identify the current squad members then the individual player pages to find out their birth places and the clubs they had previously played for. I then used the pages for these towns and clubs to get the geo-coordinates for each city or stadium.</p>
					<p> This meant I was able to display the journey for each player to their current club in three ways:<br>
					- The direct distance from their birth place to their current club's stadium.<br>
					- The cumulative distance travelled from their birthplace, to the first club they played for, then the next and so on throughout their careers until they arrived at their current club.<br>
					- The number of different clubs they had played for. This would highlight the real "journeyman" players even if they hadn't travelled far geographically.</p>
					<p>I then presented each set of data in two ways. Firstly as a combined total for each club. This should show whether the reputation some clubs have for relying on foreign players was justified or not. Secondly, ordered by individual players so we can see the details of where each player was born and exactly which other clubs they played for during their journey to the Premier League.</p>
					<p>The charts are created using D3.js and I animated the transformation between each chart as the user chooses new data to display.</p>

					<p>The first of two data visualisations (the other is shown above) based on <a class="ext" href="http://www.ufwc.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Unofficial Football World Championships</a> which imagines what would happen if the Football World Champions were not decided once every four years at a tournament but instead followed the boxing model.</p>
					<p>This simple animation loops through all of the 926 championship games so far played and shows the two teams competing as well as the details of the game.</p>
					<p>The visualisation builds up adding each new country as they appear in the championship game and a connection between the countries that have played each other.</p>
					<p>The countries are grouped by continent and the numbers after each country name indicates how many times each team has either won or defended the championship.</p>
					<p>The visualisation is built using D3.js and all the data was sourced from the <a class="ext" href="http://www.ufwc.co.uk/results/" target="ufwc">UFWC website</a>.</p>

					<p>A series of charts visualising some of the statistics from the 2016 Olympics. The data was scraped from a variety of sites including the BBC live Olympics coverage and Wikipedia.</p>
					<p>The first visualisations are bar charts which show the ranking of all countries at the games on a variety of criteria:<br/>
						- The number of athletes each nation sent to the Olympic Games.<br>
						- The total number of medals each nation won.<br>
						- The total number of gold medals each nation has won.<br>
						- The number of competitors each nation sent to the Olympics per million of population.<br>
						- The number of medals each nation won per 100 competitors they sent.<br>
						- The number of gold medals each nation won per 100 competitors they sent.<br>
						- The number of medals each nation won per million of population.<br>
						- The number of gold medals each nation won per million of population.</p>
					<p>This gave an interesting way of showing how some of the smaller nations were overachieving based on their country populations or the size of their Olympic teams with Cook Islands, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Grenada and Bahamas topping some of the tables. The site even got attention on some asian news sites when North Korea were top of the "medal efficiency" table. (They eventually finished second after a late surge by Azerbaijan.)</p>
					<p>A <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4348373" class="ext" target="blocks">"zoomable sunburst"</a> showed the total number of medals across all sports. Athletics, swimming and rowing gave out 150 gold medals between them whilst there were only 2 to compete for in Triathlon, Golf and Modern Pentathlon.</p> 
					<p>The chart that caused the most controversy was the "Sport Dominance" table with each event ranked by the "dominance" of the key nation. Sports where all the events were won by one nation (South Korea/archery, Table Tennis/China) were at the top whereas events with the golds evenly spread (the 5 Tennis golds were won by 5 different nations) were at the bottom. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4yzwcf/which_olympics_sports_where_most_dominated_by_one/" class="ext" target="reddit">Reddit</a> users argued over whether winning all 4 archery golds really was "more dominant" than winning 17 of the 35 swimming golds.</p>
					<p>All charts were made using D3.js based on <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock" class="ext" target="blocks"> Mike Bostock's</a> examples.</p>

					<p>An exercise in using D3.js and SVG to create data visualisations of cocktails and their ingredients. Inspired by this <a class="ext" href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/cocktails/" target="_blank">original visualisation</a> by Tatjana Dubovina & David McCandless I wanted to make an entirely dynamically generated version.</p>
					<p>The data was taken from <a class="ext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cocktails" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and is served in JSON from a MySQL database. For each cocktail the ingredients are dynamically drawn based on the order and volume of each specified in the recipe. The maths involved to draw the shapes so that they followed the outline of the more complicated glass shapes (also drawn dynamically) was the trickiest bit.</p>
					<p>The completely dynamic rendering of the glass, ingredients and all text/labels means that it would be easy to expand the menu simply by adding more recipes to the 70 already in the database.</p>

					<p>Fans of Game of Thrones know that Valar Morghulis (all men must die) but when over 200 named characters have already gone to meet The Seven (or The Old Gods, or The Drowned God, or The Lord of Light, or The Many-Faced God of Death, or the Great Stallion, etc...) then it gets hard to keep track of the tragedy.</p>
					<p>This branched chart shows exactly who killed who as the body count increases through the 6 series so far.</p>
					<p>The data was scraped from the excellent <a class="ext" href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki" target="got-wiki">Game of Thrones wiki</a> and the data representation is implemented using Mike Bostock's <a class="ext" href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock" target="d3">D3 library</a>.</p>
