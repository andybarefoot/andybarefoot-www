The data can be downloaded from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/metmuseum\/openaccess\" class=\"ext\" target=\"github\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p><p>This data visualisation attemts to show the distribution of the entire collection by date and to show the difference in age depending on the type of artifact. For example, the majority of vases in the collection are from around the year 300 A.D or before. <\/p><p>The original data used over 1000 distinct classifications which I grouped into 36 wider classifications as best as my understanding of the classification names allowed.<\/p><p>The data provides a text description of each object's date as well as &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; dates which bookend the possible timeframe taking into account any inaccuracy of the date. So for an object described \"early 7th-mid 7th century BC\" the start and end dates are -675 and -650.<\/p><p>For an object with a range of possible creation dates this visualisation distributes the object across the full range. So an article made between 1840 and 1850 is distributed as 1\/11 of an object for each year in the range 1840-1850 inclusive. This is why some years are shown as having only fractions of an item.<\/p><p>The visualisation was made using D3.js after the raw data had been consolidated into JSON using PHP.<\/p>",

At the same time the map zooms to display an area defined by the bounding boxes of the two countries competing the match. The country of the winning team (defending champion in the case of a draw) is displayed in gold and the losers in silver.<\/p><p>The total number of successful challenges or defences of the title is maintained throughout the animation and displayed on each country.

This data visualisation looks just how far the players have travelled to play in the Premier League.<\/p><p>I scraped all the data from Wikipedia at the beginning of the 2016\/2017 season using the pages for each club to identify the current squad members then the individual player pages to find out their birth places and the clubs they had previously played for. I then used the pages for these towns and clubs to get the geo-coordinates for each city or stadium.<\/p><p> This meant I was able to display the journey for each player to their current club in three ways:<br>- The direct distance from their birth place to their current club's stadium.<br>- The cumulative distance travelled from their birthplace, to the first club they played for, then the next and so on throughout their careers until they arrived at their current club.<br>- The number of different clubs they had played for. This would highlight the real \"journeyman\" players even if they hadn't travelled far geographically.<\/p><p>I then presented each set of data in two ways. Firstly as a combined total for each club. This should show whether the reputation some clubs have for relying on foreign players was justified or not. Secondly, ordered by individual players so we can see the details of where each player was born and exactly which other clubs they played for during their journey to the Premier League.<\/p><p>The charts are created using D3.js and I animated the transformation between each chart as the user chooses new data to display.<\/p>",

The data was scraped from a variety of sites including the BBC live Olympics coverage and Wikipedia.<\/p><p>The first visualisations are bar charts which show the ranking of all countries at the games on a variety of criteria:<br\/>- The number of athletes each nation sent to the Olympic Games.<br>- The total number of medals each nation won.<br>- The total number of gold medals each nation has won.<br>- The number of competitors each nation sent to the Olympics per million of population.<br>- The number of medals each nation won per 100 competitors they sent.<br>- The number of gold medals each nation won per 100 competitors they sent.<br>- The number of medals each nation won per million of population.<br>- The number of gold medals each nation won per million of population.<\/p><p>This gave an interesting way of showing how some of the smaller nations were overachieving based on their country populations or the size of their Olympic teams with Cook Islands, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Grenada and Bahamas topping some of the tables. The site even got attention on some asian news sites when North Korea were top of the \"medal efficiency\" table.

Athletics, swimming and rowing gave out 150 gold medals between them whilst there were only 2 to compete for in Triathlon, Golf and Modern Pentathlon.<\/p> <p>The chart that caused the most controversy was the \"Sport Dominance\" table with each event ranked by the \"dominance\" of the key nation. Sports where all the events were won by one nation (South Korea\/archery, Table Tennis\/China) were at the top whereas events with the golds evenly spread (the 5 Tennis golds were won by 5 different nations) were at the bottom. Over on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/comments\/4yzwcf\/which_olympics_sports_where_most_dominated_by_one\/\" class=\"ext\" target=\"reddit\">Reddit<\/a> users argued over whether winning all 4 archery golds really was \"more dominant\" than winning 17 of the 35 swimming golds.<\/p><p>All charts were made using D3.js based on <a href=\"https:\/\/bl.ocks.org\/mbostock\" class=\"ext\" target=\"blocks\"> Mike Bostock's<\/a> examples.<\/p>",
