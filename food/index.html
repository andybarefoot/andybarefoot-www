			<p>The Chocolate Chip Cookie is a classic. The King of Cookies. A timeless masterpiece and the favourite of America’s foremost cookie connoisseur: Cookie Monster.</p>
			<p>It was invented in 1938 by Ruth Graves Wakefield who named it the Toll House Cookie after the inn she owned. The original recipe, as shared in a 2017 interview, consists of just 10 ingredients, mainly fat, sugar, flour and chocolate chips, mixed and baked.</p>
			<p>Pretty simple. However in the intervening 79 years the chefs of the world have not been satisfied to leave a bona fide classic alone. So many have tried to modify and improve the humble CCC that we are now at the regrettable situation where a search for “Chocolate Chip Cookie” on yummly.com returns an astonishing 29,921 recipes.</p>
			<p>For the home cookie maker it leaves an obvious but impossible to answer question: Which of these recipes is the best?</p>
			<p>“Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies” from The Guardian website is the most popular with over 3000 “Yums” but has a below-perfect average rating of 4.1/5 from 7 reviews.</p>
			<p>“Chocolate Chip Cookies” from Manu’s Menu has a perfect rating of 5/5 but from only 3 reviews and boasts a paltry 230 “Yums”.</p>
			<p>And what about the rest? Has anyone ever scrolled all the way down to recipe 29,921 and tried it? Perhaps it is the greatest recipe ever formulated. Perhaps it renders cookies of such breathtaking deliciousness that after one bite Otis Spunkmeyer would hang up his floppy white hat and denounce his life’s work as a meaningless sham. We don’t know. Even trying to scroll that far would wear the tip of your finger to the bone. How can we ever be sure which is the definitive Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe?</p>
			<p>We can’t. But with such a large dataset we can at least submit ourselves to the wisdom of the crowd. We will utilise these millions of hours of kitchen experimentation by thousands of nameless internet chefs. We will take all these recipes, mix them together, stir vigorously and bake in the pre-warmed oven of data analysis until we have the scientifically(-ish) proven <strong>greatest ever chocolate chip cookie recipe</strong>. The pinnacle of milk-dunking perfection.</p>
			<p>Or failing that the mathematically established “most average”.</p>

			<p>First, lets take a look at the sheer number of recipes. Can there really be 30,000 versions of the CCC? Do they all really produce something Ruth Wakefield would recognise as a Toll House Cookie? Or is Yummly a bit too over zealous with its search results?</p>
			<p>The Yummly filters should allow us to reduce that number down a bit. Exploring the “cooking techniques” filter reveals that 2,834 recipes involve microwaving, 1,228 boiling, 128 broiling and even a singular result each for braising and brining. We won’t be using any of these techniques so we will limit our analysis to the 17,153 recipes that involve baking.</p>
			<p>Also worryingly there are 51 recipes classed as “More Spicy” and 190 classed as “More Sour”. These don’t sound like ideal characteristics for a definitive CCC so we’ll also filter these out. </p>
			<p>Finally we can filter on whether a recipe contains a certain ingredient. Now we can make CCCs with shortening or butter, with plain or self raising flour but the one ingredient we can’t do without is chocolate chips and if we filter the recipes for this most essential of ingredients we reduce our dataset to 13,272.</p>
			<p>(We aren’t going to cater for any allergies but its still reassuring to know that even if you are allergic to dairy, egg, gluten, peanuts, seafood, sesame, soy, sulfites, tree nuts AND wheat there are still 44 recipes you can use.)</p>
			<p>[Editorial note: For now I have scraped 913 recipes from the Yummly site but ideally I would use their API to access the entire database]</p>
			<p>Having analysed the remaining 913 recipes we can see the most common ingredients:</p>
