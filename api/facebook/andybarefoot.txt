Can anyone help?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI had a marketing video card thingy which I took apart to find:<br \/>\n- a 7-inch (non-touch) screen<br \/>\n- connected to a circuit board<br \/>\n- which had an attached battery<br \/>\n- speaker<br \/>\n- usb port<br \/>\n- and a magnetic switch<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhen the magnet is removed from the switch a video auto-plays.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhen I connect via USB and look at the file structure I see a lot of files, but apart from the mp4s nothing that I know how to do anything with. So far the best I've managed to do is replace the default video with a video of G\u00fcnter (hardly rocket-science). <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAny suggestions for how I could edit the software to do something more interesting?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOtherwise I'm assuming I could buy one of these to use the screen with a raspberry pi: https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/adafruit-dpi-display-kippah-ttl-tft","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=10157795478480578&set=a.202442530577.260321.729980577&type=3","name":"Photos from Andy Barefoot's post","date":1479657343,"full_picture":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/15095002_10157795478480578_3353464971953958766_n.jpg?oh=00905d3d88d8a3a96d529765bd9bec22&oe=59597AF4","picture":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/s130x130\/15095002_10157795478480578_3353464971953958766_n.jpg?oh=772fd223438d6f3e80fc0ff7654bb298&oe=59965BF9"},{"facebook":"true","id":"729980577_10157749480875578","type":"video","message":"\"its time to stop thinking that reposting an article on your Facebook feed is political engagement\"","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/attribution_link?a=8n0qg8xNEaM&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGLG9g7BcjKs%26feature%3Dshare","name":"President Trump: How & Why...","caption":"youtube.com","description":"Pie thinks he knows who is to blame for the rise of Trump...and you're not going to like it!
