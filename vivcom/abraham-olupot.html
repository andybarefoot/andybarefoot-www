        <h1>Abraham Olupot: Programs Director</h1>
        <img class="text-photo" src="images/team/abraham.jpg">
        <p>My name is Abraham Olupot a born of 1st-January-1989 and raised in Kampala Slums. Charity to me is honoring God’s calling upon my life and as a way to walk and follow the footsteps of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who clearly said to us that the greatest commandments are  to Love God with all your heart ,body, spirit and soul plus all your belongings and Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Jesus Christ displayed the love of the poor by attending to them whenever they came to seek for any assistance from him, He displayed this character by doing servant leadership for example when He washed the feet of His disciples, He eat with the poor, the less privileged, and He once said He did not come for the upright but for those in need. God still encourages the spirit of giving to Humanity by giving to us his only Beloved Son Jesus Christ who died for our sins and brought salvation unto us, so in giving you save a soul from perishing and extend the love of God on Earth since you will be a vessel God will be using to reach out to his people, and giving is a double edged sword, where the receiver attains the basic needs and this build the kingdom of God on Earth and the poor will be praising His Holy name Jesus Christ for Remembering them, and to the giver it is an eternity saving and God rewards you with blessings both in Heaven and on Earth. “He who closes his eyes to [the poor] receives many curses.” (Proverbs 28:27)</p>
        <p>Lord your God redeemed and saved you from your past situation and therefore He commands you to do this. “When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over them again. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not strip it afterward. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow. (Deuteronomy 24:17-21)</p>
