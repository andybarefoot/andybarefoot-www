        <h1>Lukanga Musoke Godfrey: Treasurer</h1>
        <img class="text-photo" src="images/team/lukanga.jpg">
        <p>My name is Lukanga Musoke Godfrey, born on 22nd-June-1990 in Kampala slums, my life was full of challenges, hardships, discomfort and a series of disappointment, living in the ghetto taught me many lessons in life, that being poor in life confronts you with all sorts of diminishing behaviors like drug abuse, prostitution and the list is endless, This abject poverty champions the choices in your life, since your voice is always inferior in the community. Children are confronted with a lot of challenges which a few can overcome and the rest fail and end up becoming un-fit in society.</p>
        <p>So I joined VIVCOM Foundation to use my skills to bring impact in the marginalized communities and empower them for sustainable development but this vision can be realized if you different stakeholders join hands with us to make the future of the children secured.</p>
        <p>Behold children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward, like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one’s youth. Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.Psalms127:3-5</p>
        <p>For God has chosen me and you to nurture our children and our household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, God uses us as vessels to reach out to the oppressed and deprived communities so that the Lord may bring to us Blessings and Favor He promised to our fore fathers like Abraham.”(Genesis 18:19)</p>
        <p>Remember the Bible tells us not to merely listen to the word of God but to do what it says, Take what your read here, write it down and put it into action! (James 1:22)</p>
