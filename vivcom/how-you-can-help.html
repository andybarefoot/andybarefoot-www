        <h1>How You Can Help</h1>
        <p>Become our partner! Get involved with us in a variety of ways and make a lasting impact on the Vulnerable Communities we serve as it can be seen below:</p>
        <h2>Krispy Kreme Doughnuts</h2>
        <p>Offer a discounted quality and quantity of your delicious doughnuts, and confirm to our customers that you are doing this for charity, this is a fun way of raising money because it increases your sales and hence send the money to our project.</p>
        <h2>Sponsorship Forms</h2>
        <p>This is where innovative and clever ideas work best. Would a local sports team grow beards, go bald? Would a local company have a "dress down" day? Many people love doing daft things for charity and take great delight in doing something with a real purpose. Ask for our special sponsorship forms and get cracking.</p>
        <h2>Smartie Tube</h2>
        <p>The old ideas are often the best ones. You give your friends, work colleagues, neighbors a tube of Smarties on the condition they pop in a $2 U.S Dollars then hand it back when full. A Smarties tube will raise a whopping $54. Go on, try it!</p>
        <h2>Bag Packing</h2>
        <p>Dressed in our VIVCOM Foundation T-shirts we reckon most supermarkets would offer you a day or two to help pack bags at the checkouts. Get them to mention it regularly as a tannoy announcement and ask customers just to spare a bit of loose change for a good cause. If you shop in a supermarket you will appreciate just how essential nutritious food is- for everyone.</p>
        <h2>Simply Donate</h2>
        <p>We never underestimate the simple act of giving and asking others to give something as well. Unfortunately, Orphans and Vulnerable Children are regularly in the news so their despair is self-evident. A donation of any size is very welcome so make sure to thank people and tell them what we do.</p>
        <h2>Piggy Back</h2>
        <p>This involves scanning your local newspaper or notice boards and spotting events where you could have a fundraising stall. The list is endless and many organizers will give you a free stall for a good cause. It could be a donation stall with our publicity material or you could sell things to make money. Now, where did I put that paper?</p>
        <h2>Swear Box</h2>
        <p>Not that we swear of course but life is often stressful and work places are no exception. So while we can't condone bad language that occasional donation to a conveniently placed donation box is often a good idea.</p>
        <h2>Car Washing</h2>
        <p>This is another old favorite. There are lots of small business doing this now so be sensitive as to where you operate. You will need a good supply of warm water; sponges and shampoo so why not start in your street, Church/mosque car park or a cafe at lunchtime? This idea is best done in a team to maximize effort and income.</p>
        <h2>Dress Down Day</h2>
        <p>This is similar to a non-uniform day but in a work environment. Many companies allow this Friday so why not tap into this growing tradition and make it work for the orphans and vulnerable children. Everyone benefits and productivity will probably increase.</p>
        <h2>Collection Boxes</h2>
        <p>It's another simple idea. Find a retail outlet, restaurant, garage reception or anywhere where customers are in and out all of the time and seek permission to leave a secure box for, say, a month. Visit weekly to collect donations and thank the business owners for the opportunity.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Organize your own challenge, from a swim-a-thon to pooh sticks, from time trials and races to long walks and mini Olympics. Everyone loves a challenge that helps other people as well.</p>
        <h2>Talent Show</h2>
        <p>This is also a great idea for schools, colleges, universities and women's group for example. Make it a ticket event and charge a bit extra for refreshments. Display some of our posters, leaflets and offer a short talk about what we do.</p>
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>The list is limited only by your imagination, Dinners, Fashion shows, concerts, quizzes, Guest speakers, Garage sales, car boot event, Place a donation jar at your workplace, Raffles, Poker casino / games nights, Trivia nights, Barbeque day, night, Music and comedy nights, Golf tournament day, Car boot market, Bingo nights, Sponsored run, Half marathon, village fete or street party, anything from a family affair to hiring a large venue for hundreds of people.</p>
        <h2>Bucket Collection</h2>
        <p>You might need formal permits from local authorities, so check out bye-laws or necessary approval on private property but it is a straight forward way of getting funds in. Try your local supermarket or sports ground, railway station and shopping centre. Most people understand that the world's poorest, need support. A winning smile and a genuine appeal for support will often do the trick.</p>
        <h2>Non-Uniform Day</h2>
        <p>What an opportunity to impress your own school teachers or your children's school. For an opportunity to be an outrageous, show-off with a great reason for doing so. Use the opportunity to publicize VIVCOM Foundation and make more people aware of what we do. Dress inappropriately (within reason) for $4 U.S Dollars and watch the coins pour in.</p>
        <h2>Vecome a Virtual Volunteer</h2>
        <p>Discuss ideas on how to increase our awareness, involve your school or company in fundraising events and become an advocate on behalf of VIVCOM Foundation.</p>
        <h2>Festive Season Gifts</h2>
        <p>Many organizations, companies, churches and homes offer gifts as well as grants during festive seasons as their individual contributions towards charities, You can share with the less privileged by donating to them.</p>
        <h2>Occasion Party</h2>
        <p>Like Birthdays, graduations, anniversary- you can host fun-filled event and ask your friends to bring a gift or a financial contribution in honor of festivity. No contribution is too small!</p>
        <h2>Community Networking</h2>
        <p>Join our community at face book and Twitter. You will be able to meet other well minded people, upload videos and share news and ideas that can have a positive impact on our mission.</p>
        <h2>Create Your Own Web Page</h2>
        <p>Dedicate a web page that you create for VIVCOM Foundation. You can easily upload a direct link to our website as well as a DONATE NOW button so that your friends can make a contribution easily and securely.</p>
        <h2>Share Child Sponsorship</h2>
        <p>With your church, class or family - Invite a group of friends or loved ones to share a sponsorship with you.</p>
        <h2>Tell Us Your Idea</h2>
        <p>Is there a creative and fun way that others can easily join to make a difference? Share those ideas! We would love to hear them.</p>
